# QueueLine-Program
This system manages a bankâ€™s customer queue using a LinkedList. Customers join the end with "ENQUEUE name" and leave the front with "DEQUEUE." It efficiently tracks arrivals and departures. At day's end, it prints all waiting customers or "EMPTY" if none, ensuring smooth queue handling and customer flow.
